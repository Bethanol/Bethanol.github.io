        <h3 class="section">D&D As a Whole</h3>
        <p class="description">
          In this day and age D&D is getting increalingly popular. It has become one of the most popular table-top roleplaying games.
          However, that does not make the game easy to learn. Even though it's one of the easier table-top games to learn, it is still
          rather complicated and heavily math based. This is a mistake many new players make. In turn, many new players will give up
          entirely on playing the game. This site works to oversimplify the rules of D&D to make it easier for new D&D players to start.
          It seeks to be an easy and player friendly way to teach new players the basic rules. We will go from the basics all the way
          to the most popular homebrew rules. Below are summaries of each section.
        </p>

      <div class="site_info">
        <h3 class="section">Base Stats</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The base stats section of this webpage will go over the 6 basic stats of the game. Intelligence (Int), Dexterity (Dex),
          Strength (Str), Charisma (Cha), Wisdom (Wis), and Constitution (Con). These basic stats all influence seperate parts of the
          game. They are the building blocks of character creation. To learn more click the image bellow.

        <h3 class="section">Abilities</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Abilities are character stat roles that influences what your character can do, see, or hear. Each ability is influenced by
          both proficiency and your basic stats. The only stat that does not effect at least 1 of these stats is constitution. To
          learn more click the image below.

        <h3 class="section">Saving Throws</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Think of saving throws as your characters reflexes. The saving throw will depend on the reflex that the character will be
          required to perform. For example, if you're trying to move out of the way of a falling object you'll use Dex. However,
          saving throws will mainly be up to the dungeon master's (dm's) ruling. Each saving throw colaborates with its respective
          stat. To learn more click the image below.

        <h3 class="section">Proficiency</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Proficiency is how good your character is at something. Whatever your proficient in are the things that you are more likely
          to succeed in. You can be proficient in many things from abilities to items. Some proficiencies will be decided by class while
          others will be up to player choice. However, it is best to choose proficiencies in the things you are already good at. To

		</div>
        <h3 class="section">Races</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Races in D&D are pretty self explanatory. It is of course the races that you are allowed to play as in the game. What race
          you play determines a few of your abilities and base stats. Each race has different abilities and stat enhancements that help
          with certain classes. Not only that, but their are also some homebrew races that your dm will allow you to play as. To learn
          more click the image below.

        <h3 class="section">Classes</h3>
        <p class="description">
          There are 12 playable classes in the Players Handbook alone. Each class has their own pros and cons. For example, warlock is a Cha
          class, while rogue is more Dex based. Additionally, each has their own subclasses that change their play style. Not to mention
          there are quite a few hombrew classes and subclasses for each class. To learn more click the image below.

        <h3 class="section">Spellcasting</h3>
        <p class="description">
          There are nearly an infinite amount of spells in D&D. They all have different types of saving throws, uses, conditions, damage,
          etc. There are 8 categories of spells. There is also a major difference between cantrips and actual spells. The difference lies
          in when you can cast them, how you can cast them, and how many times you can use them. To learn more click the image below.

		</div>
        <h3 class="section">Conditions</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Conditions pertain to the many debuffs an enemy or a player can have. Each condition effects the person and an aspect differently.
          In total there are 15 conditions that someone can be affected by. To learn more click the image below.

        <h3 class="section">Homebrew</h3>
        <p class="description">
          There are many hombrew aspects of D&D. There are hombrew rules, races, classes, subclasses, etc. Everyone plays D&D differently,
          therefore it's usaully up to dm dissgression. There are so many homebrew things that I'm only going to go over the ones that I
          have experianced and those that are the most popular. Furthermore, on this page anyone can post their own experiances playing
		  with homebrew or just the playing the regular game in general. Here you can read their experiances to get a better idea of how
		  the game works. To learn more click the image below.
