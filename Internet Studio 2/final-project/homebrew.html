        <h3 class="section">D&D as a Whole</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Now what I think is the greatest thing about D&D is that no one plays it the same way. That's right some of these rules that I took
          so long to disscuss might not even be used. But that's up to your dm. Your dm makes the game, the experiance, the characters, and the
          world. Now because this is a factor I can't teach you everything there is to know about D&D. So instead I will teach my experiances
          with these homebrew rules that I have encountered.

        <h3 class="section">Base Stat Rolling</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Now as I have explained how the base stats, abilities, and saving throws all worked with each other, but how do we get those numbers
          in the first place. There are a few ways to get these stats however the one that I have experianced the most is rolling for stats.
          The way this works is that you use 4d6's and roll them all at the same time. Then you take the lowest number out and then add the
          other 3 rolls together as shown below. However I have had many dms that don't like to leave it too much to chance. I've had a dm who
          always replaced your 2nd lowest stat with an 18, a dm who said I could re-roll if I got below a 10, and even had a dm that alowed me
          to re-roll 1s that I got on the d6's.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Overpowered Class Aspects</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Another thing great dms do is game balance. Now the game itself is already pretty balanced, Wizards of The Coast made well sure of that.
          But sometimes the rules can be too vague. If a player is abusing something that really shouldn't be abused, then of course you need to 
		  balance the
          game. For example, one of the things that I ran into was an exploit. I was playing a rogue and a rogue has something called flanking.
          What the rules said was basically if an ally was within 5 feet of me and attacking the same enemy then I could proc sneak attack. I won't
          lie I abused this fact. Until finaly the dm had to put his foot down and banned flanking from our campaign. And now I have never had a dm
          since then that allowed flanking.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Homebrew Classes</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Homebrew can be one of the best things in the world. Especially if you colaborate your plans with your dm. Many dms love making homebrew
          items, weapons, races, and classes. Even I did this once. My group and I were all prepping for a D&D one-shot in our dm's universe. I was
          under the impression that this one-shot was going to be absolute bat shit insane. So I decided to go bat shit on my character creation. Now
          I won't lie I have no idea how I got my dm to agree this, but he and I collaborated together to make, and I shit you not, a piss gun. It was
          fully operational with napalm, sleep, and berserk rounds. Colaborate with your dms, you might be suprised.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Homebrew Worlds</h3>
        <p class="description">
          When I first started D&D with my friends we were just playing one of the easiest modules to begin with. But after that, we immeadiatly jumped
          into homebrew. Ever since then my friends and I have prospered in the many worlds my dms have thrown us in. The fights, the roleplay, the fun
          it is so undeniably intoxicating. These worlds that your dms build for fun, it's not for nothing.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Make Your Own Rules</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Since D&D is such a relative game with all its homebrew aspects, I figured why not try to make you own homebrew rules. Just fill out the boxes
          below press the button and watch it be added to the section.
