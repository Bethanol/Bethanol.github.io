      </div>
      <div class="general">
        <h3 class="section">What are conditions?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Conditions in D&D are basically just debuffs in any other turn based rpg. Each condition is different in its own way. If you fail the
          saving throw in your attempt to avoid the condition you will be debuffed. These things can make or break a fight. You being there at
          the wrong place at the wrong time can end you in a snap. Now that that's out and about let's go over each condition.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="site_info">
        <h3 class="section">Blindness</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Blindness is of course a debuff that makes you blind. You can't see, well anything, for a period of time. No enemies around you, allies,
          nothing. For the mechanics of the game the affected creature will have disadvantage on its attack rolls as well as those who attack
          the affected creature get advantage. Not only that, but the affected creature will automatically fail any ability checks pertaining
          to sight.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Charmed</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Being charmed is like being coerced into thinking that your greatest enemy is your bestest friend. Not only will you not harbor any
          malicous feelings towards them, but they get advantage on ability checks that involve socializing with you. If you fail the save you can
          no longer attack the caster. However, you will get a chance to remake the save everytime you take damage.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Deafened</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Just like blindness, deafened is pretty straight forward. You can't hear a thing if you fail the saving throw. The affected creature,
          just like blindness, will automatically fail any ability check that involves hearing. Pretty straight forward.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Frightened</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Frightened is another one of those pretty obvious conditions. If you fail the save you will be scared of the caster. Terrified and
          afraid you have little choice but to run. The effected creature has disadvantage on all ability and attack rolls while the source
          of their fear is still in sight. Additionally, they can't move any closer to the source of their fear either.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Grappled</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The grappled condition occurs when an enemy attempts to grab you. If you fail the save you are grappled and held in place by the
          enemy. While grappled you can't move. You'll have to spend your turn trying to get the grappler off of you or trying to kill them.
          You can also cast spells or use aspects of your class to try and stun them or knock them back.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Incapacitated</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Incapacitated doesn't necesarily mean unconscious or pinned down. There are several spells in this game that fuck with a creatures
          mind. Incapacitated just means that a creature loses the will to or is forced to stop fighting. An incapacitated creature cannot
          make actions or reactions. Hence they cannot do anything but move around the battle field.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Invisible</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Now this is one of the conditions that isn't a negative one. Think of it more as a buff than a debuff. An invisible creature cannot
          be seen, unless magic or special senses are utilized. Afterall, they are invisible. Enemies who try to attack an affected creature
          do so at disadvantage.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Paralyzed</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Paralyzed creatures are well, paralyzed. They can't move or speak and they even follow the same rules as incapacitated creatures.
          Moreover, a paralyzed creature automatically fails a Str or Dex saving throw. So if a Str or Dex spell hits you, you will take full
          damage no matter what. Not only that, but enemies who attack the effected creature get advantage on their attack rolls and will
          automatically crit if they are within 5ft. of the effected creature.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Petrified</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The petrified condition pertains to being transformed and imobilized in some sort of way, usually by stone. The affected creature
          also gains weight by a factor of 10 and is unaware of its surroundings. It follows the incapacitated condition, and, just like
          paralyzation, the affected creature automatically fails Str and Dex saves, can't move, can't talk, and enemies who attack the 
          affected creature attacks at advantage. However, the affected creature also gains all resistances. Resistances are things that 
		  can help you halve specific damage. For example, if my character has a resistance to fire damage, all fire damage done to me is 
		  halved. There are also immunities and vulnerabilities that your character can have. If your character has an immunity to a specific
		  damage type then you will never take any damage from that specific type. Meanwhile, if your character has a vulnerability to a damage
		  type, you will take double the amount of damage from that type. You can aquire these from what race you pick, certain feats, and what 
		  class you choose.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Poisoned</h3>
        <p class="description">
          A poisoned creature is exactly how it sounds. If you fail the save, you will take poison damage over time until you die or finaly
          make the save. Furthermore, the affected creature will also recieve disadvantage on attack roles and ability checks since you are
          basically dying of poison.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Prone</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The prone condition occurs when an enemy knocks you on your ass. You will be prone until you stand up, which you can only do on
          your turn. If a party member helps you up during their turn it will also end the condition. When prone, enemies get advantage on
          their attack rolls if they're within 5 feet of you. If they aren't they get disadvantage. While you are on the ground you will
          also have disadvantage on attack rolls until you get up.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Restrained</h3>
        <p class="description">
          A restrained creature is one who is tied up or tangled in something. It's basically when a character gets a bit too intertwined
          in an oppsticale. Now, an affected creature cannot move at all and has disadvantage on their attack rolls. Meanwhile, opponents
          get advantage when attacking the affected creature.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Stunned</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The stunned condition is what you expect. It's basically that old cartoon you watched as a kid where the bad guy gets smaked and
          gets little starts floating around his head. The affected creature is again incapacitated. They can't move, however they can speak
          just falteringly. The creature will automatically fail Dex and Str saving throws and again people who attack the affected creature
          will get advantage.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Unconscious</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Unconsciousness can happen in 2 different ways. Either 1) a spell knocks you unconscious, say sleep for example, or 2) you drop to 
		  or below 0
          health. Unconsciousness is one of the most dangerous conditions you can have, because it usually means you are about to die. Now
          since there are 2 ways to go unconscious there are 2 ways it can affect you. First let's start with the effects that happen in both
          ways. When you are unconscious you are incapacitated, automatically fail Str and Dex saving throws, are unaware of your surroundings,
          can't move, can't speak, falls prone, enemies get advantage against affected creature, and will automatically crit if they are 5
          feet from them. Now if you are knocked unconscious by a spell this is all that pretains to you. However, if you are knocked
          unconscious because you are at or below 0 health than you have to do something extra. This something extra is called a death save. It
		  is where
          you roll a straight d20 to see if you can get back up. 1-10 you fail 11-20 you succeed. Now you need to fail 3 times in order to die
          and the same goes for if you want to get back up. Additionally, if you get attacked while you are unconscious you will recieve an 
		  automatic failure, but if you are healed while unconscious you will get back up with how ever many hit points you were healed for.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Exhaustion</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Exhaustion is a condition that you can really only cause yourself. This condition only happens if you don't sleep. There are a total
          of 6 levels of exhaustion. Each day you don't sleep each level you go up. See the table below to see the debuffs you can get from
          exhaustion.
        </p>
        <div class="tables">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Exhaustion Level</th>
              <th>Debuff Recieved</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>Disadvantage on all Ability Checks</td>

            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Saving Throws</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>HP Max Halved</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>Character Can no Longer Move</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>6</td>
              <td>Death</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
