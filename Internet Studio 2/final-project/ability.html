        <h3 class="section">Abilities and Their Respective Stats</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Abilities are divergents of your base stats. These are many things that you can do with your stats. Each of these abilities mach
          up with its respective stat. In turn, each of these abilities will have the same modifier as its respective stat. The only thing
          that will change that fact will be proficiency, more on that in the proficiency tab. For this section we will be going over the many abilities that will dictate
          roleplay. The only stat that won't be covered is Con, because it is the only one that doesn't have any respective abilities.
        </p>

      <div class="site_info">
        <h3 class="section">Str Based Abilities</h3>
        <p class="description">
          There is only 1 Str based ability. This ability is athletics. It will mainly be used to out do someone in, well athletics.
          It's a measure of how well you can exert yourself in order to do what you want. Say that you're chasing someone through the city.
          You would roll an athletics check in order to see if your character can keep up with whoever you're chasing. Additionally, if you
          want to tackle said person you would also roll an athletics check to see if you're successfull.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Dex Based Abilities</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The Dex abilities include stealth, slight of hand, and acrobatics. Stealth is pretty self explainatory. It pertains to how well you
          can hide from and avoid people. Your dice roll will basically measure how well you can go incognito. Next, the slight of hand
          ability refers to how well your character can use their hands without anyone noticing. It's mainly used for pickpoketing, lockpicking, and other careful hand
          movements. These actions would be heavily sought after by thieves, as you can see. Lastly, acrobatics is how flexible and agile you
          can be. It can be used for climbing and manuvering around dangerous terrain or when trying to do a backflip if you want.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Int Based Abilities</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Arcana, history, investigation, nature, and religion are the 5 Int based abilities. Arcana will mainly pertain to figuring out anything
          magically inclined. Whether that is figuring out how to cast a spell, identifying a spell, or making any kind of magic item, arcana
          will encompass anything magic. History mainly pertains to memory. This ability will help you remember important names, places, and
          times. This usually is used for lore and roleplay reasons. Next, investigation is how well your character can figure something out
          by analyzing clues. Basically how good you are at being a detective. Moreover, nature is an ability that of course pertains to plants
          and animals. It is used to identify or analyze nature in general. Finaly, religion is used to identify religions. It can go through
          the history and ideals of all the religions in the game, whether they be homebrew or already a part of the many gods in the game already.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Wis Based Abilities</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The Wis stat represents the animal handling, insight, medicine, perception, and survival abilities. The animal handling ability is
          used for taking care and managing animals. With this ability your character may befriend or nurse animals back to health. However, 
		  be careful. Remember, your success is determined by a dice roll. Who knows what can go wrong. Next, the insight ability pertains to how well you can empathize
          and understand people. It is a good ability if you want to try and tell if someone is lying or not. Medicine is as straight forward
          as it sounds. It is used to try and stabilize and bandage wounds. This ability is mainly used as a last resort if no one in the party
          can heal. Additionally, perception is also very obvious. It is what you can glean from the surrounding area. It's basically your
          sense to sus out odd characters or things in your current enviornment with a single glance. To finish off, survival is your ability 
		  to track and treck the wild. These rolls are used for, you guessed it, your own survival.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Cha Based Abilities</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The Cha abilities are deception, intimidation, performance, and persuasion. Deception is of course your ability to lie and decieve.
          You can lie to anyone in the game, just like in real life. However, the dice determine how beleivable you are. Intimidation refers
          to how scary you can make yourself out to be. Basically, it's a very easy way to coerce the answers you want or to just make yourself 
		  as intimidating as possible. Next, performance
          pertains to how well you can preform. Whether it be dancing, sining, stand-up, etc., preformance will be your roll. Finaly,
          persuasion is used to convince others to your side, obviosly. It determines how good you are at making your case and how well you can 
		  persuade others.
