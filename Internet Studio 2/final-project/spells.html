        <h3 class="section">The Rules of Spellcasting</h3>
        <p class="description">
          As we saw on the the classes page their are many magic casters in this game. We have also gone over how we defend oursleves from magic
          using saving throws. But how do we actually cast magic? Magic in this game can be a bit complicated. Let's start off with, there are 2
          types of magic. Cantrips and spells. Spells are strong bursts of magic that can cause devestating blows or game breaking debuffs to
          enemies. Because they are so stong is precisly why they have a limit. Each time you cast a spell you use a spell slot. This basically
          marks how many limited times you can cast spells. To calculate how many spell slots you have will all depend on your level and class.
		  For more information on that look through the classes on the classes tab. Now on the other side there are cantrips. These are weaker 
		  attack spells that don't
          use spell slots. So if you run out of spell slots you aren't entirely screwed. Basically, these are spells you can always use whenever you
          want. However, if you are in combat you can't cast a cantrip or spell twice in 1 turn. For example, I can't cast a spell on my turn as
          a bonus action then cast another spell as my main action. Same thing goes for a cantrip. If I cast a cantrip on my bonus action I can't
          cast another on my main action. However, you are allowed 1 and then the other. So say I cast a spell as my bonus action, then I could
          use my main action to cast a cantrip. Now that we know how to "cast" magic let's go over the types of magic.

      <div class="site_info">
        <h3 class="section">Abjuration</h3>
        <p class="description">
          These types of spells and cantrips focus on protecting the caster. These spells are meant more to disrupt other casters spells instead
          of focusing on damaging or killing the caster. They are meant to be used for peaceful resolve or defensive restraint. This is never
          meant to cause harm. Spells like resistance and alarm are in this category.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Transmutation</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Transmutation is exactly what it sounds like. These spells are meant to transform whatever matter their caster wants. Casters who
          use this seek to shape and change the world around them. Targetted objects can either change there form completely or just alter
          its configuration. Mending and control flames are great examples of this type.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Conjuration</h3>
        <p class="description">
          These spells are focused in fast movement and transportation. Teleporting and summoning creatures are also a big part of this spell type.
          Even some healing spells are included in this type. This type of spell usually pertains to bards. Acid splash and poison spray are
          included in this type.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Divination</h3>
        <p class="description">
          This type is mainly used to sort and figure things out. Any spell that gives further insight or information about a certain place,
          person, or thing fits in this section. These spells are meant for those wishing to identify what the problem is or how to fix it.
          Detect magic and comprehend languages are great examples of this spell type.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Enchantment</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The enchantment spell type is used to alter creatures minds to either act a certain way or become more amiable to the caster. There
          are 2 types that seek to alter the mind. 1 is compulsion, or getting someone to act a certain way, the other is through charming them.
          Charm person and command are the best examples of this.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Evocation</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Evocation is a spell type based around creating matter and energy. These types of spells are going to be the damage dealers. They pull
          from a destructive energy and blast that energy at enemies and opponents. Spells like magic missile and burning hands are great examples
          of the destructive enrgy casters can create.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Illusion</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The illusion spell type is one of the more obvious spell types out there. It of course focuses on the creation of illusions. This type
          of spell is used to create distractions, like big noises or big scary monsters, to even changing the appearnce of the caster. Therefore,
          minor illusion and disguise self are the perfect examples for this type.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Necromancy</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Now due to general media, necromancy is of course associated with the haunted and the undead. While yes this is still the case in D&D
          it's not all about resurecting the dead. Necromancy is a spell type that deals with the dead in general. In other words, not everything is
          about resurecting the dead when you can just make the dead. Inflict wounds and spare the dying are good examples of this.
