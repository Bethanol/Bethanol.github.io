        <h3 class="section">Proficiencies and There Uses</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Proficiency is one of the most important aspects of D&D. Proficiency will add a proficiency bonus to the ability, attack roll, spell
          save, and/or tool kit you are proficient in. This proficiency bonus will be added to your current modifier that the item, ability, or
          saving throw already requires. For character creation you are allowed to choose ability and tool proficiencies. However,
          weapon, spell casting, and saving throw proficiencies are decided by your class, see the classes tab for more information. Additionally, 
		  your proficiency bonus changes as your
          character levels up. Not to mention there are other proficiency bonuses that you can aquire. For this section we will look at all the
          types of proficiency bonuses as well as all the other bonuses.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="site_info">
        <h3 class="section">Proficiency as a Whole</h3>
        <p class="description">
          As said above proficiency will add an extra buff to the things you are proficient in. Your proficiency bonus is the same for every
          class. It just changes as you level up throughout the game. At level 1 it starts at a +2, and as it goes up to the max level, level 20,
          you will eventually gain a proficiency bonus of +6. The table and example below will explain how proficiency bonuses work with modifiers. Now keep
          in mind that your ability, saving throw, and attack roll modifiers are all just your base stats reprinted without proficiency.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="section">Ability Proficiencies</h3>
        <p class="description">
          These proficiencies add your proficiency bonus to your ability modifiers. This means depending on what stat the ability is based
		  off you will add the stat's mod to your proficiency mod. So for example, if you are proficient in stealth you would add your Dex modifier,
		  the stat the ability is influenced by, to your proficiency modifier. This is also one of the few proficiencies you can willingly choose to
		  give to your character. This will of course buff your character's modifiers and make them more likely to succeed in the abilities you are		  
		  proficient in. Therefore, the strategy for these proficiencies is to give your proficiency bonus to the abilities that rely on your higher
		  stats.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Tool Proficiencies</h3>
        <p class="description">
          This is also one of the few proficiencies you can willingly choose during character creation. These tools can be some of the best and
          worst items in the game depending on your dm. There are so many tool kits to be proficient in. From the lute to the thieves tools,
		  these tools can help immensaly or be entirely useless. What you can do with these tools all depends on the tools and your imagination.
		  For example, thieves tools are good for breaking into places and picking locks, while an herbalism kit might be used for creating health
		  potions or poisons. When you get to use these tools your dm will ask you to roll a specific stat that they believe matches what you're
		  trying to do. If your proficient with these tools you'll get your proficiency bonus along with this roll.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Weapon Proficiencies</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Now this is one of the proficiencies that gets decided based on what class you play. Different classes will use different weapons.
          Granted that doesn't mean you can't try and use a weapon you're not proficient in, you just will have a harder time hitting what
          you want to hit. Each class has a very different fighting style. In turn they need different weapons to match how they're played.
          As said before, attack rolls are based on what weapon you use and if you are proficient in said weapon. Most martial weapons, like
          axes and hammers, are strength based. This means there attack modifiers are calculated by adding your strength modifier to your 
          proficiency modifier if you are proficient in these weapons. All other weapons are used with dexterity, like bows and daggers. You
          will use your Dex modifier and your proficieny modifier, if you are proficient, to calculate these attack roles.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="section">Spell Proficiencies</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Spell proficiencies are actually the same as weapon proficiencies just they're used for magic casters. Now if you know a spell you
          will always use your proficiency bonus with that spell. Now how you use it will depend on what spell you are casting. If the spell
          is a roll to hit spell you will add your spell casting stat modifier, which varies from caster to caster, to your proficiency bonus, 
		  just like other attack rolls discussed above.
          If you are casting a spell that requires an enemy to make a saving throw you calculate the roll they need to get by adding 8 + your
          spellcasting stat modifier + your proficiency bonus, as shown below.
        </p>
        <div class="interactive">
          <div class=statType>
            <label for="level_2">Level:</label>

              <option value="9-12">9-12</option>
              <option value="13-16">13-16</option>
              <option value="17-20">17-20</option>

          </div>
          <div class="modChange">
            Spell Save: <span id="spell_save">&nbsp;</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="section">Saving Throw Proficiencies</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Now suprise, this is another proficiency you don't get to willingly choose. As always it will depend on what class you choose to play.
          These proficiencies will be added by the stats your class focuses on. For example, if you play as a bard your save proficiencies will
          be in Dex and Cha, while if you play a monk your saves will be proficient in Str and Dex. However the class is meant to be played you
          will have to take those proficiencies. To calculate saving throws with proficiency works exactly the same way as ability proficiency.
		  All that is required is adding together your proficiency mod to the mod the saving throw is based on.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Armor Proficiencies</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Armor proficiency is what armor you work best in. This is also an aspect that will influence AC. For a description on AC and how to
          calculate it go to the Base Stats page and look under the Dexterity section. This is another proficiency that depends on the class that 
          you have chosen to play. Now just like weapons you can choose whatever armor you want to wear. However, you are going to get mad 
          disadvantages if you don't wear the armor you are proficient with. Now when I say disadvantages I mean it as an actual rule of the game. 
          Disadvantage is a rule of the game that will require you to roll 2 d20s and take the lower roll. Now there is also a rule called advantage. This 
          works the same as disadvantage except you will take the higher of the 2 rolls. Moving on, armor proficiency works a bit different than 
          the other proficiencies. This is the one proficiency you don't add your proficiency bonus to. The way you treat this is only if you are 
          wearing armor you aren't proficient in. As I said before if you are wearing armor you aren't proficient in you will get disadvantage on
          a lot of your ability checks. If you are proficient then you won't get any of these disadvantages. The only exception is that medium and heavy
		  armors always have disadvantage to stealth, no matter what.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Other Proficiency Bonuses</h3>
        <p class="description">
          There are 3 other proficiency bonuses in this game. Twice proficiency, expertise, and half-proficiency. Each one has its own respective
          bonus. Furthermore, these bonuses will only adhere to abilities. To start off, twice proficiency is a very situational proficiency bonus.
          If you're making a stat roll and a very specific situation occurs you get to double your proficiency bonus on that related check. Expertise
          is basically the same thing, but it isn't situational. If you have expertise any time you roll that specific ability check you get to add
          double your proficiency mod. Lastly, half-proficiency is when you get to add half of your proficiency bonus to an ability check. All 3
          bonuses are exemplified below.
