        <h3 class="section">What are saving throws?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Saving throws basically act like your character's reflexes. You usually roll saving throws to defend against spells or traps. The
          roll to make will usually be determined by the spell or trap used. Now just because you make the save, doesn't mean you're
          completely safe. Usually if you make the saving throw you will take half damage instead of full. For rounding questions refer to
          your dm. Just like abilities, saving throws pertain to their respective stats and the only thing that can change them is proficiency
		  , which will be explained in the proficiency tab. For this section we will go over what each saving throw will usually do.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Str Saving Throw</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Str saving throws will mainly be used to oppose a strong moving force. This force could be anything from a thunderstorm or earthquake
          to a tarasque or bandit. It would be for trying to hold on or pull yourself up after falling off a ledge or trying to catch a boulder
          that has been thrown at you. Things like this are what Str saving throws are for.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Dex Saving Throw</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Avoidance and dodging are the key points of Dex saving throws. These saving throws are mainly for moving out of the way for an object.
          For example, fireball is an area of effect (aoe) spell that does massive damage. In order to defend against it you must roll a Dex
          saving throw in order to dodge the flames. However, even if you make it you will still take half damage, because it still is a massive
          fireball coming at your face.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Con Saving Throw</h3>
        <p class="description">
          The Con saving throw is meant for those spells and traps that attack your physical and biological well being. In other words, anything
          that's meant to poison, drug, spread disease, stress, or fatigue your character. It's basically your body's natural biological
          resistances and processes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Int Saving Throw</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Mind fuckery and mind alteration are the effects that Int saving throws protect against. This saving throw revolves around figuring
          out an illusion or protecting against memory alteration. So say an illusion is directing you to a dangerous area. With a good Int
          saving throw you'll be able to figure out immeadiatly it's a fake.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Wis Saving Throw</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Wis saving throws are used to protect against psychic damage and emotional manipulation. It is meant to help keep ones self from
          being magically manipulated to do something that you wouldn't normally do. For example, dominate person is a spell that charms and 
          forces another creature to do the bidding of the caster for a full minute. A Wis save is then needed to avoid this fate.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section">Cha Saving Throw</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Cha saving throws pertain to the effects of mind control and possesion. It's meant to fight against any spell or condition that
          forces a loss of conscious control or personality. The roll is made to protect against the loss of ones self. So if a spectre
          tries to possess you, you would use this saving throw to force them away.
