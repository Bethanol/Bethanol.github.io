        <p class="description">
          Before we get to the intricate terrain of classes I need to explain how combat works. Each player will get 2 things to do on their turn:
          actions and bonus actions. Actions tend to be things like attack or cast a spell. There are a number of things you can use your action
          for however. You can use your action to basicly do whatever you want on your turn. You can interact with an object, prepare an attack for
          when something specific happens, grapple to try and restrain an enemy, etc. However, it is up to your DM in how successfull you are in 
          these actions. Now bonus actions are just actions that your character can do on the same turn. Some spells count as bonus actions, so you
          cast those spells and then use your action for something else. These bonus actions are special to what class you pick. Additionally, when it isn't your
          turn you can use an action called a reaction. These are again things specific to classes. The one reaction that isn't specific to class is
          oppurtunity attack. This means when it isn't your turn and an enemy leaves your range of attack you can attack them as they try to run. You
          can only use reactions once per your turn. This means that you have to wait your next turn until you can use your reaction again. Now that 
          we have gotten through so many of the mathematecal aspects of D&D, let's jump in to the most fun part of character creation. Choosing a class. 
          In total there are 14 classes in the game. Each has their own set of aspects at each level. I will be focusing only on the classes in the 
          players handbook. Therefore, I will only be going over the 12 classes that appear in this source book. This is because these are the classes 
          you will gauranteed get to play. Every other class is up to DM discretion. I will be only going over the basic framework of these classes. I
			do not wish to scare the new players with overwhelming terminology.
          This will include their most used class aspect, where they get their power from, and what stats they best work with. Now if you do wish to look at the other classes
          that I did not mention on this page, you can click this link here(<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes">all player classes</a>) and peruse 
          them as you wish.
