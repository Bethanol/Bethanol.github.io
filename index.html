	<h3>Artist Statement:</h3>
	<p class="list">In 1993 Tim Brenes-Lee created the first web browser and editor called Mesh. Additionally, he created the first web page 
	and web server. Now, the web has become a staple tool in our everyday lives. That being said, that does not make it a perfect
	tool. Many websites are still infuriating to navigate, use, or even sign up for. For example, finding where to make an account
	can sometimes be a hassle or trying to find a certain page on a website can be nigh impossible. For me as a person this is 
	infuriating. Especially since I am so easily frustrated. In turn, I seek to ease the user experience for the user and my own 
	sanity. I use HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, and SQL to accomplish this. I tend to code my work for ease of use and interactivity. 
	I use HTML or PHP to build the basic structure of the site, CSS to make the layout and design, and Javascript and SQL to program
	the interactivity of the site. Each of these languages work very well in tandem. I program my work for the user experience. Every 
	aspect is meant to try and give the user a good and easy experience. I do keep them in mind especially, because I know how 
	frustrating it is to figure out a website you’ve never been to before. During my first year of college I found that I took a liking
	to coding. I started out by learning Javascript, C#, and C++ to try to program games. After 2 years trying to do that I decided to
	switch to web design because the coding languages were a bit easier for me to work with. Not only that, but I took a slight interest
	in psychology and design research. Both of these things taught me how the human mind works and how to  more accurately empathize with
	others. In turn, I started coding for the user experience. Since then I have been trying to enhance and improve the user experience
	online. The first web server was nothing more than a tiny laptop. In 1993 Tim Brenes-Lee created the first web page and web server on
