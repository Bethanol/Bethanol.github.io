<div id="biscotti-introduction">
<p>These traditional Italian <span class=biscotti>biscotti</span> are fool-proof. I know, because my mom and I have been making them for years. They're classic no-frills biscotti that are just chock-full of toasted whole almonds and laced with fragrant orange zest. They're satisfyingly firm rather than jaw-breakingly hard, which makes them ideal for dunking in hot coffee. Biscotti can be made ahead and stored. Given their sturdy texture, they stand up well to packing, so they make a great edible gift to mail. </p>

<p>Biscotti, as you may know, is Italian for “twice-cooked” – so if you like a bit of a crunch, put those biscotti back in the oven again for a second round of baking. The longer these Italian biscotti stay in the oven, the crisper they will get. Although it is a well-known practice to bake these biscotti cookies twice, personnel preference should dictate for how long, if at all. These Almond Biscotti are fantastic even without the second baking.</p>

<p>Another well-known fact is that biscotti will last forever! Well, maybe not forever… but you get my point. Because they are baked twice, there is little moisture in the dough. Since biscotti are a low moisture cookie, this will allow you to store them at room temperature, where they will keep for a few weeks. It is best to keep them in an air tight container.</p>

	<ol>
	<li><span>In a large bowl, hand mix toasted almonds, sugars, cinnamon, baking powder, and flour.</span>
	<span>In a small bowl, whisk eggs. Add the vanilla and orange zest and whisk until well blended. Add to the flour mixture. Work the batter together with lightly floured hands. The mixture will be sticky, but persevere. Keep squeezing the batter with your hands, until a dough starts to form. Once the dough is firm, form a ball. Divide the ball into four equal pieces.</span></li>
	<li><span>On a lightly floured surface place one piece of dough, and using your hands, roll into a log shape that is approximately 8 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 3/4 of an inch high. Repeat with remaining three pieces of dough. Place two logs per baking sheet.</span></li>
	<li><span>Bake for 40 minutes, or until the tops of the loaves are shiny and deep golden. Cool on a rack for about 20 minutes before slicing. Place a loaf on a cutting board, and using a large serrated knife, slice cookies 3/4 of an inch thick on the diagonal. If the cookie is crumbling, then let it cool a few more minutes. Don't let it rest too long, however, or they could become too hard to slice.</span></li>
	<li><span>Place slices on their sides back on to the baking sheets; place in the still warm oven with the temperature off and the door closed for 30-60 minutes. The longer they stay in the oven, the harder they will become. Remove from oven and cool completely before storing in an air-tight container, preferably a tin, which helps keep them crisp. Stored properly, biscotti will last up to a month.</span>
